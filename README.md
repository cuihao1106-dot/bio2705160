## This is the operational process 
### 1. Put all scripts and sample sequence fragments in the same directory. Run 'a.sh', 'b.sh', 'c.sh', and 'd.sh' to obtain complete samples e.g. 'sampleA.fasta'.
### 2. For each sample, we have 4 of their reference sequences in 'ref_seq.zip' e.g. sampleA has 'A1.fasta', 'A2.fasta', 'A3.fasta', A4.fasta'. After decompression, place all '.fasta' sequences in the same directory.
### 3. Run 'translate.py' to translate all sequences to amino acid sequences. 
## Then we can go to next step. Do MSA on EBI web using the amino acid sequences.
